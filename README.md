## Introduction:
The history of transportation starts from the age of humans and has continued to change over some time. The first means of transportation was the human foot.
The history of transport has undergone a radical change with the introduction of wheels. Existing means of transportation were continuously improved after that, for example, horse-drawn vehicles (carts or karts).
Until the gas and fuel cars were invented

Cars are one of the most important necessities for every family, as they are the most popular means of transportation these days.

This project aims to predict the price of used car market in the UK, predict car prices by type, engine, and car model.

We will do a regression models to predict the prices of used cars to attract customers so that our exhibtion are among the best and we can achieve the company's goal and vision for development in the used car sectors

## Algorithms:
After we explore data, we wil creates our Regression models to predict car prices, and comapre them to find the best model.


## Data Description:
The data set is provided in .csv format,  contains information of price, transmission, model, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size. 

The data set was extracted from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes

 | Model | In this column, the model of the car shows us the name of the car.(e.g., ford Kuga.)| 
 | Year | In this column, shows the year of manufacture of the car (e.g., 2012)                |
 | Price | This column shows the cost of car (e.g., 60000)                                     |
 | Transmission | It shows us the type of car transmission (e.g., Manual) .                    |
 | Mileage |In this column, It shows us the distance the car has traveled in miles             |
 | Fuel type |in this column, it shows us the type of fuel (e.g., Petrol)                      |
 | Mpg | In this column, it shows us the distance covered by the car per gallon                |
 | Engine | Size In this column, it shows us the engine capacity of the car                    |
